# What it do

Chrome uses shit encryption for their passwords, or maybe its windows fault, who knows. This exploits that and then posts the passwords via a discord webhook. 

## How to use

Change discord webhook to your own, run it.
## Best way to ship it?

Convert it from python to go or c or cpp etc. then compile it and stash it in a seperate file. when i get bored again ill convert it to golang then you can just run go build on the fucker. If you wanna do it with python like the skid you are then change file extension to pyw and idk, pray the user is dumb enough to run it. The python version is just simply PoC to make sure i can do it.
